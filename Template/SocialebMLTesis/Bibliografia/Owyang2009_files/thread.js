We are already seeing it happen in many customer situations -- the community takes on greater and greater ownership of the brand.  Companies love this strictly becasue they see it is driving commerce for them -- we have some that are seeing shopping cart sizes increase -- other see over 40% increases in sales.</p>\n\n<p>With that sort of result -- in a capitalist environment -- my belief is that companies will actually push to make eras 2-4 become reality if it is serving to drive era #5.

I am particularly interested in the era of \"social colonization\" which we are just beginning. Just this week, Facebook announced new extensions to the stream API. Developments like this should accelerate the pace at which community, identity, and privacy traverse the web with us, which brings about exciting new opportunities for product development by publishers and application developers, many of which were tried and failed during earlier eras of the web. The \"socially colonized\" web brings about fertile soil for new products and product adaptations across a variety of verticals, and I'm really excited about it.</p>\n\n<p>Justin</p>", "approved": true, "is_last_child": false, "author_is_founder": false, "can_reply": true, "likes": 0, "user_voted": null, "num_replies": 0, "down_voted": false, "is_first_child": false, "has_been_anonymized": false, "highlighted": false, "parent_post_id": null, "depth": 0, "points": 0, "user_key": "be3cb88191e44b8346d4d80fbfa849b4", "author_is_creator": false, "email": "", "killed": false, "is_realtime": false}, "23797538": {"edited": false, "author_is_moderator": false, "from_request_user": null, "up_voted": false, "can_edit": false, "ip": "", "last_modified_date": null, "dislikes": 0, "raw_message": "Great article!
