	platform, spanning all connected devices; Web 2.0 applications are
	those that make the most of the intrinsic advantages of that platform:
	delivering software as a continually-updated service that gets better
	the more people use it, consuming and remixing data from multiple
	sources, including individual users, while providing their own data
	and services in a form that allows remixing by others, creating network
	effects through an \&quot;architecture of participation,\&quot; and
	going beyond the page metaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences.},
