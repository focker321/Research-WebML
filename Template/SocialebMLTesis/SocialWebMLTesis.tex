\chapter{Process}
\label{chap:Process}
	\section{Web 2.0}
	\cite{O'Reilly2007} quotes that Web 2.0 appear when it's accompanied by some features, although  it doesn't mean that these are the only ones to characterize the excellence in Web 2.0.
	\cite{O'Reilly2007} and \cite{Frattini2007} say that the next principles summarize the Web 2.0:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{The web as a platform:} to services more complex
		\item \textbf{Harness collective intelligence:} user contributions are the most important resources to be exploited
		\item \textbf{Blogging and the wisdom of the crowds:} people are the main actor
		\item \textbf{Data as the next Intel Inside:} data owning, can be turned into opportunities for companies
		\item \textbf{End of software release cycle:} user must become in developers.
		\item \textbf{Lightweight programming models:} ``remixability'' of contents and services.
		\item \textbf{Software above the level of single device:} not personal computer usage only; it must turn in ubiquitous computing
		\item \textbf{Rich user experience:} Users prefer easy-to-use, essential and effective interfaces.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Model-Driven Development}
	As one the booms in web 2.0 is that in [aï¿½o cuando nacio y una peke explikacion....] where we can see that systems functionalities may first be defined as \ac{PIM}, after this given a \ac{PDM} corresponding to the Web, the \ac{PIM} may then be translated to one or more \ac{PSM} for the actual implementation \cite{Frattini2007}.
	``Architecture'' in a model-driven approach does not refer to the system components.
	The design addresses the functional (use cases) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through nonfunctional requirements.
		\subsection{Model-driven development process}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Models are the key elements; express the results of the different activities
			\item The level of abstraction of software development $\rightarrow$the model level.
			\item Functional requirements and their implementation are separated from non-functional aspects, etc.
		\end{itemize}

	\section{\ac{WebML}} % 10 to 15 pages
	\label{sect:WebML}
	\cite{Nugraha2007} and \cite{Matera2003} say \ac{WebML} is a modeling language (\ac{DSL}) which describes the composition, navigation, and content, organization and representation in a hypertext, for specifying the content structure of a Web application. The language is geared towards providing a high-level specification of web applications, which can then be transformed into executable code by means of a \ac{CASE} tool which must provide a visual representation, conveying the essential feature of its primitives what can be visualized in diagrams, drawing from the concepts of \ac{ERD} and \ac{UML}. Also is provided with an \ac{XML}-based textual representation. Thanks to all these is easier to master the complexity of Web application development. 
	
	\cite{Brambilla} says \ac{WebML} also is a methodology with a high-level notations for data, service and process centric web application. It allows specifying the data model of a web application and one or more hypertext models that can be based on business process specification and can exploit web service invocation, custom back-end logic and rich web interfaces.
	
	As reported in the Figure ~\ref{fig:WebML_Process} the \ac{WebML} approach have different phases, \cite{Ceri2003} reports that this design was inspired by Boehm's spiral mode, the \ac{WebML} process must be applied in an iterative and incremental manner in which various phases are repeated and refined until results meet the application requirements.
	
	\begin{figure}[here]
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/WebMLProcess.png}
		\caption{The MDD Process}
		\label{fig:WebML_Process}
	\end{figure}
	
	Although we can see several phases, we can differentiate 4 very pronounced states when we model/work with \ac{WebML} that \cite{Brambilla} names as follow:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{WebML Data Model:} \ac{ERM}, \ac{UML} class diagram primitives + relationships called derived + declarative languages like \ac{OQL} and \ac{OCL}
		\item \textbf{WebML Hypertext Model:} Definitions of the front-end interfaces of the Web Application (about internal organization in terms of components $\rightarrow$ content units)
		\item \textbf{Presentation mode:} Graphic appearance
		\item \textbf{Personalization model:} Styles
	\end{itemize}

	\section{WebML Method at a glance:}
	As we saw furthermore to be able to distinguish four marked phases we will try to exploit each one of the basic phases doing an analysis with the classical methodologies \cite{Matera2003}\cite{Frattini2007}:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Requirements analysis:}Collecting information about the application domain and expected functions, and specify them through easy-to-understand descriptions.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Input:} Business Requirements
			\item \textbf{Output:}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Identification of the groups of users
					\item Specification of functional requirements
					\item Identification of core information objects
					\item Decomposition of the web application into site views
				\end{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Some diagramas to use \cite {Fowler2003}}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \textbf{Activity diagrams} $\rightarrow$ Usage scenarios, Activity asynchronous
					\item \textbf{Use cases} $\rightarrow$ Groups of users (hierarchical)
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Conceptual modelling:} Consists of data design and hyper-textual design, here we can see the first two marked phases named previously:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Data design:} Data schema possibly enriched through derived objects, we can report some important activities:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textbf{Group modelling:} Requirements of user groups into entities and relationships.
				\item \textbf{Identification of synchronization objects:} Similar to producer-consumer life cycle in which we see which actor works with each object and his interactions with this.
				\item \textbf{Identification of shared objects:} Here we see what object is used in what phase.
			\end{enumerate}	
			Here we have 2 notation: \ac{ERN} and \ac{UML} but commonly is used the \ac{ERN} where entities are defined as \textit{containers} of data elements and relationships defined as \textit{semantic connections} between entities. Entities have named properties, called attributes with and associated type. Entities can be organized in generalization hierarchies and relationships can be restricted by means of cardinality constrains \cite{Matera2003}.
			\item \textbf{Hypertext design:} Here we start to design and produce site views sachems on top of the data schema previously defined.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Site view:} Specific set of requirements. It consists of areas which are main sections of the hypertext and comprises recursively other sub-areas or pages which are the actual container of information delivered to the user.
				\item \textbf{Content Units:} Publish piece
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Data Unit:} one attribute $\rightarrow$ one entity instance
					\item \textbf{Multi-data Unit:} $\eta$ attributes $\rightarrow$ $\eta$ entity instance
					\item \textbf{Index Unit:} list attribute $\rightarrow$ one entity instance  (choose one)
					\item \textbf{Scroller Unit:} browsing ordered set of objects
					\item \textbf{Entry Unit:} forms
					\begin{figure}[here]
						\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/Unit.png}
						\caption{Unit Content}
						\label{fig:Unit}
					\end{figure}
				\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Pages:}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[H] (ome Pages) 
					\item[D] (efault)
					\item[L] (andmark)
					\item Links / unit = contextual link
					\item Link / pages = non contextual link
				\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Behaviors:}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Automatic links (A)} absence of a users' interaction, page accessed
					\item \textbf{Transport link (dashed arrow)} pass context information
					\item \textbf{Set Unit} set globally parameters
					\item \textbf{Get Unit} get globally parameters (e.g. id user, etc)
				\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Output Link:}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{OK} success
					\item \textbf{KO} fails
				\end{itemize}

%Description of a case study application, Social WebML models, examples of the generated code, deployment and testing, experiments with users 


In this chapter we present a case study for describing the development of the \textit{''Web ratio Travel Agent''} application, the application based in a extension of a classical Travel Agent.
In order not to move the reader's attention from the Social \ac{WebML} development process to the real complexity of a Travel Agent business context, we decided to simplify a real case.
	
\section{Context}
\section{Requirement Analysis}
	\subsection{Business Requirements}
		Actors
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Administrator:} It is in charge of managing the while ``application''.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Create a new ``travel'' (dates, places, etc. notification about themselves).
					\item Define kind of ``travel'' (pleasure, studies, interchange, etc.).
				\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Users:} They can subscribe to a ``travel''.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Booking a trip
					\item $[$pre--condition$]$ $\rightarrow$ they first must be registered in the application.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Identification of Groups}
		\label{subsec:Identification of Group}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Administrator (pre--inserted by a system administrator)
			\item User (registered by himself)
			\item Anonymous (Non--registered people)
		\end{itemize}
		These features are described more deeply in the Table ~\ref{tab:definitionAttributes}

		\textbf{Note:} Some of these requirements might not to be known during the first analysis session.
		However, since \ac{WebML} process is iterative, requirements could even be discovered or defined or even re--defined during the following phases, so generating process iteration.
		\end{quotation}
 
		Another way to express the previously ideas is using a Use Cases Diagram with a Hierarchical Actors -- Driven Approach as the seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:hierarchicalActors}.
		
		\begin{figure}[here]
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/hierarchical.png}
			\caption{Hierarchical Actors Diagram}

		\end{figure}
		
	\subsection{Functional Requirements Analysis}
		\subsubsection{Representative Usage Scenarios}
			Here we can use also Use Cases Diagrams in \ac{UML} terminology \cite{Matera2003}.
		\subsubsection{Activities Flow}
			Here we can use also Use Activity Diagrams in \ac{UML} terminology \cite{Matera2003} where we can analyze each group separately, this is done with each group identified in the ~\ref{subsec:Identification of Group}.

			\end{figure}
					
	\subsection{Identification of Core Information Objects}
		Group analysis and Functional Analysis.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{User and group:} Fundamental for representing data about the application users, their roles can be derivate from the group, they belong to and access right over information objects and services.
			\item \textbf{Travel Data:} Properties like dates ('[' start | end ']') promotions, perform, places, quantity tracks and subjects.
			\item \textbf{Tickets:} Main information object accessed and managed in the central phase of \textit{``Inscription to a Travel''}.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Identification of Site Views}
		For each phase and for each involved user group, one site view must be defined able to support the group.
		
		\begin{table}[htbp]
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		 & Administrator & User & Anonymous \\ \hline
		Travel Set -- Up & Travel Set -- Up & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{---} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{---} \\ \hline
		Inscription & Promotion Set -- Up & Inscription to a Travel & Registration \\ \hline
		Travel Program & Travel Management Closing & Login Suspended & Travel Program Browsing \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Association between User Group and Site Views int he different Travel Agents Phases}
		\label{tab:associationUG_SV}
		\end{table}
		\begin{quotation}
			\textbf{Note:} With this part the Requirement Specification is finished, it is now when we attached the Social Requirements Specification.
		\end{quotation}
		
\section{WRTA Social Requirements Analysis}
	\subsection{Social Requirements}
		Here we present the use of an Interaction Diagram to specify the interaction between Users of the \textit{WR Travel Agency} and their friends from a \textit{Social Network} or \ac{FOAF}.
		
		\begin{figure}[here]
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/interactionDiagram.png}
			\caption{Interaction Diagram}
			\label{fig:interactionDiagram}
		\end{figure}
		
		Here we have to define some terms, e.g.:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Member:} It is a person (male, female, boy, girl, etc.) who belongs to a Social Network in which he stores, shows, updates, etc. data ``about'' himself, and he is who change the state of the application context by his behavior. \cite{Frattini2007} says that a member is characterized by his behavior, credibility and his directly responsibly for his actions within the group.
			\item \textbf{\ac{FOAF}:\footnote{More specifically we will talk about \textit{``Friend of n'th level''}}} Show the relation between 2 or more members in which from a \textit{source member} to a \textit{target member} can be share data (profile, relations, etc).
			\item \textbf{Shared Information:} Data given about oneself to another member or members with prior approval  Here we have to classes of Share Information:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Own:} Show given data with the consent from one self.
				\item \textbf{Non -- Own:} Give or show information from another\footnote{There are cases where it can be seen only for a limited number of members (\textit{visibility})} with or without the consent from information's owner  It can be perform thanks to \ac{FOAF}
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Profile:} It is a collection of personal data associated to a specific member.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{'[' Survey|Lifting ']' of Social requirements}
		Here we have to select parts of last phase specifically those which were seen in the Figure ~\ref{fig:interactionDiagram}, To be more concrete those most outstanding to make a feedback with Business Requirements or improve/complete next phases.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Get a \ac{FOAF}
			\item Get non--own valid information
			\item Get Data Profile
			\item Prepare Promotion
			\item Show Promotion
		\end{itemize}

\section{Data Design}
In the Figure ~\ref{fig:ERM} we present \ac{ERM} for WR Travel Agency.
